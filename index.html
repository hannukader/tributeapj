      <h3>HIS CONTRIBUTION</h3>
      <br>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
          <li><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-stop"></span><h4> <b>Satellite Launch Vehicle</b><br>During the 1970s, when India had hardly dreamt of its SLV, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam launched SLV III in July 1980, which deployed Rohini in near earth orbit. It was nearly a decade’s hard work of Kalam, which made this task possible.</h4></li>
        <li>    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-stop"></span>
          <h4><b>Integrated Guided Missile Development Program</b><br>Dr. Kalam was appointed as the CEO of this high-end program. Rather than backing off from this responsibility, Kalam tried in the best way possible to make it successful. As a result of his hard work and devotion, missiles like AGNI (a ballistic missile) and PRITHVI (surface-to-surface missile) came into existence.</h4></li>
          <li><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-stop"></span><h4><b> Pokhran-II Nuclear Tests</b><Br>During his tenure as Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organization and Chief Scientific Advisor to Prime Minister between July 1992 and December 1999, he took some great decisions. Dr. Kalam’s intensive technical and political help in Pokhran-II nuclear tests earned him a lot of media coverage and established him as the best living nuclear scientist in the country.</h4></li>
          <li><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-stop"></span> <h4><b>Kalam-Raju Tablet</b><Br>Dr. Kalam and Soma Raju, a well-known cardiologist, came up with a rugged tablet computer in 2012 to take care of the health of underprivileged people in rural India. It helped the government fight many health issues.
            
          </h4></li>
          <li><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-stop"></span> <h4><b>The Mission 2020 </b><br> Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was a visionary man and saw a dream of India becoming a developed nation by the year 2020. He always believed that education and the dominant young Indians could take the nation to greater heights. He will not be there to witness India’s success in the coming days, but his guidance and blessings will surely help the country to fulfill his dream.</h4>
